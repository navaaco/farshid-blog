Hello there! Welcome to Dividing Dividends! We are four business students at the University of Antwerp, Belgium who started this blog as part of a course in corporate finance and governance. Here you’ll get to know all about dividends and firms’ dividend policies. From making complex theories simple to discussing current events related to this topic, we tackle it all.

Thank you for visiting our blog! We hope you enjoy reading our posts!
