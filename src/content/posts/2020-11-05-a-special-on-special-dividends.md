Hello Readers!

This post is about special dividends and the reasons why firms decide to pay them to shareholders. Let’s start with a simple definition. A special dividend is a one-time dividend payment, which is substantially higher than a regular dividend. They usually occur after high company earnings, large sales or when a firm reaches some kind of milestone.

Obviously, shareholders are happy to receive special dividends any time, but what’s in it for the company? Here are some explanations:

1) Getting rid of excess cash

As confusing as it sounds, there’s such a thing as too much cash. Excess cash refers to the situation when a company has a lot of extra cash beyond the amount needed for financing its operations. When there’s too much cash on the balance sheet, it might be used inefficiently, the risk of bad investment increases, so distributing it solves the problem.

2) Increasing shareholder confidence

Paying special dividends can be interpreted as an indication that the company is doing well and will continue to do so in the future. Special dividends can increase shareholders’ trust in the firm, make them more loyal and more likely to remain with the company as long-term investors.

3) Hybrid dividend policy

Cyclical companies are more reliant on market conditions, with highly volatile earnings. When the company is doing well it’s better to pay out a special dividend than increasing regular dividends in time of prosperity and decreasing them during recessions. This is based on dividend smoothing, which will come back in a later post.

So far so good, but let’s not forget about potential risks and disadvantages. Paying a special dividend might be an attempt to hide the lack of good investment opportunities. It certainly is discouraging for investors and can cause stock prices to fall. There’s also the danger that a company underestimates its future need for cash, pays out a substantial special dividend and has no means to pursue value – increasing investments later.

You might have recently read in the financial news that Indian engineering and construction company Larsen & Toubro announced a special dividend of ₹18 (rupees). The reason behind this move is that the company had sold its electrical and automation business and decided to distribute part of the cash received to shareholders. As revenues of the firm have substantially declined due to the coronavirus pandemic, a special dividend is not only useful for paying out extra cash but it could also serve as a positive sign encouraging shareholders that performance is bouncing back. Management might have hoped the special dividend would boost stock prices, but seeing the effects, it wasn’t an overall success. The announcement itself resulted in a steady increase but when the amount was declared stock prices instantly fell by 5% because the special dividend was on the low side of estimates. Analysts had expected it to be between ₹18 and ₹38.
