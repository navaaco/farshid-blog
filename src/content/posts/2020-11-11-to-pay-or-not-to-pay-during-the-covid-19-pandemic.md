The current COVID-19 pandemic causes the world to experience an unprecedented economic downturn. The global economy faces its largest recession in history since the Great Depression in the 1930s, having devastating effects on nearly all industries and firms worldwide. With even much more uncertainty ahead, is it wise for companies to continue paying out their cash to shareholders? As you can imagine, the coronavirus crisis has substantially impacted many firms’ decisions on paying dividends. Whether to cut their dividend payment or suspend it entirely to conserve cash, has likely been a topic of discussion in most board rooms recently.



Several rationales have been put forward for adjusting dividend policies. One major reason firms reduce or eliminate payouts to shareholders is to preserve cash. As the future holds a lot of uncertainty, firms want to protect solvency and ensure access to capital in the future. For some sectors or firms, a dividend cut or suspension is urged by policymakers. In March of this year, for example, the European Central Bank strongly recommended banks across the Eurozone to halt paying dividends or share buybacks. The idea behind this is to save capital for lending to households, small businesses, and corporations. Many large banks, among which Belgium’s KBC, have complied. A third reason is related to the perception of the general public with regards to firms paying out to shareholders in the midst of a crisis. It does not seem justified to use resources to reward investors while cutting jobs and laying off employees. Looking at global figures on dividend payments, dividends decreased by over 20% in the second quarter of this year. Interestingly, in the years following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, firms worldwide had substantially raised payouts to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Of course, the pandemic’s implications have altered this tendency in dividend policy.



Oil companies have typically protected their payouts in times of financial hardship, but tough times call for tough measures. As one of our blog writers owns shares of Royal Dutch Shell, we thought it would be interesting to take a closer look at the changes in dividend policy of this company in particular. Royal Dutch Shell has a history of increasing, or at least maintaining, its payout year after year, even during the oil crisis. But that has come to an end. This year the company cut its dividend for the first time since the Second World War. Demand for oil has significantly declined as people simply travel less due to imposed restrictions. The company’s quarterly dividend was cut by two-thirds, from 47 cents to 16 cents per share. Whether all these dividend cuts and suspensions are here to stay is just as uncertain as the future itself.
