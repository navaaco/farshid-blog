Are you ready for some dividend theory? So we have talked about the benefits of the reasons for paying dividends. But something we haven't discussed is the fact that dividends might cause a tax disadvantage. As Benjamin Franklin wrote in 1789: ‘Nothing is certain, except for death and taxes’.

When we start considering taxes on dividends and capital gains, the following question arises: “What is the impact of taxes on companies’ dividend policy?” Imagine a firm that has 10 million dollars to distribute to its shareholders and it can decide to use the cash to pay dividends or to repurchase its own shares. Without taxes, there will be no difference. In the first case the shareholders get 10 million dollars as dividends, and the company's value drops by the same amount, and in the second case they receive 10 million dollars from the repurchase. Quite straightforward, right?! This is basically what the famous finance scholars Modigliani and Miller proposed in their dividend irrelevance theory. In a perfect capital market, which implies no taxes, dividend policy is irrelevant.

Now let’s see what happens when taxes are introduced! Let’s assume the tax rate on dividends equals the tax rate on capital gains, say 20%. In case of a dividend, the shareholders will get 8 million dollars in dividends after taxes, and the after-tax capital gains will equal that amount. In reality, the taxes on capital gains and dividends are not always the same. If the tax rate on capital gains remains 20%, but the tax on dividends is 40%, then there’s a major difference for the shareholder. In case of a share repurchase, the investors will gain 8 million dollars after taxes, whereas the amount will only be 6 million dollars in case of a dividend.

For a long time, taxes on dividends have exceeded those on capital gains. Isn’t it odd then that companies keep distributing dividends? Well, somehow dividend-paying companies are rewarded with higher valuations by investors. This idea is termed the dividend puzzle. And it is still a puzzle until this day! Even empirical studies are inconclusive. In 1976, Black (1976) said: “The harder we look at the dividend picture, the more it seems like a puzzle, with pieces that just don’t fit together”. Since then, numerous studies have been done, but there are still some missing links in the dividend picture. Cohen (2002) breaks down this phenomenon in three parts. First, it is argued that companies pay dividends because of inherent uncertainties. A second explanation is the dividend signalling theory, which we will tackle in a later post. And lastly, the dividend yield has been on a declining path because of the dividend policy where payments are made to carry information about future earnings prospects. We won’t dive into that further, at least not yet. So be sure to check out our post soon on the dividend capture strategy, which might also be a reason for higher valuations.
