Hello Readers!

In this post we are going to take a look at the Dividend Signalling Hypothesis in relation to dividend policy.

As we learned from Miller and Modigliani, in perfect capital markets, the firm’s choice of dividend policy is irrelevant and doesn’t affect share prices. However, real-life capital markets have their fair share of imperfections, one of them being information asymmetry between managers and outside shareholders. This is the reasoning behind the dividend signalling theory, according to which managers use dividend payments to signal firm value to investors. In this context, a company’s dividend policy is basically a means to transmit inside information to the market.

“So how does this work exactly?” you might ask. The theory implies that the changes in dividend payments reflect managers’ opinions about future earning prospects and the performance of the company. But before we go any further with this reasoning, it’s also important to mention the idea of dividend smoothing. It means that firms consciously keep their dividends relatively stable: either constant or they increase them with a steady growth rate that can be maintained for a longer time period. It’s simply because they assume investors prefer it that way. As a consequence, we don’t usually see major changes in dividend payments and the small changes we do see are rather infrequent. Here in this graph we can see that dividends are much less volatile compared to earnings.

So now we have the signal part covered, but what about the interpretation? According to the theory, when a firm initiates or increases a dividend, investors tend to interpret it as a positive sign. They take it as a strong belief by the management that the firm will be able to afford a higher payout to its shareholders in the future and that often causes stock prices to increase. On the other hand, a decrease or elimination of dividends is considered a negative sign by investors, which prompts stock prices to fall.

Now, let’s take a look at a real-life example. At the end of 2015, the then largest North American pipeline company, Kinder Morgan, announced a massive cut to its quarterly dividend, reducing it to $14.90 cents from $51 cents. The reason behind this move was “to take action to maintain its investment-grade debt rating”. Reacting to this announcement, shares of the company immediately dropped to $14.90, due to a significant 5,3% decrease.

Although empirical evidence confirms that there is validity to the dividend signalling theory, we have to be careful not to overestimate its importance in every situation. Dividend policy is a highly complex structure and therefore can’t be determined by a single factor, such as managers signalling company value. For instance, an increase in dividends might be the consequence of the lack of good investment opportunities. Also, a company might decrease its dividend to save cash and pursue positive NPV projects that increase company value and boost stock prices. You see, interpretation is key!
