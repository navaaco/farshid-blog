We hope you enjoyed reading our previous post about the dividend signalling theory, as we are going to tackle another famous theory called the 'dividend capture strategy'. The main idea is that investors seek short-term income, but it may not be as effective as it seems at a first glance.

Investors in dividend-paying stocks face a raft of confusing dates related to dividend payouts. These don't matter much for investors who plan to hold their shares for the long term. But they can be worth considering in deciding exactly when to buy or sell. Some investors play a game called "dividend capture," holding a stock just long enough to receive a dividend. Knowing each of the key dates in the dividend distribution schedule is key to making this strategy work, although many experts warn it's not the sure thing it appears to be. The key dates which investors need to know are declaration, ex-dividend, record, and payable date. These dates seem to offer a great opportunity. You could buy the stock before the ex-dividend date in order to receive the dividend, then sell the stock a day or so later to avoid risk, and pocket the cash. Seems like those investors are making a quick buck, right?

Some active traders do this, but it's not the slam dunk it seems. Cash put aside to pay the dividend is a company asset that is reflected in the share price. Once that cash is paid out, the share price drops because assets are reduced. A $100 stock would decline to $99 after paying a $1 dividend. At least, that’s what happens in theory. The dividend-capture game relies on the fact that share prices don't always perfectly move with dividend payments, as price is affected by many factors, not just dividends. But even if the investor can make a little profit, there are costs such as taxes and trading commissions to be paid. Not to mention the risk of the share price falling even if it's owned for a very short period of time. The trader can never be sure the share price will hold up after the dividend is paid. And identifying stocks suited to a dividend-capture strategy takes a lot of work and a lot of luck too.

Going back to our long-term investor focused on total returns, he can postpone a purchase until after those dates to avoid the tax on the dividend. If the share price falls after the dividend is paid, the investor will buy at a lower price – always a good move. For most investors, the key dates are just a good way to know when dividend income will arrive. They're convenient for budgeting, nothing more!
